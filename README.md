TR-2063 Drum Machine

This application provides a basic sequencer, sampler and live drum pad.

To use the application in sequencer mode hold the phone in the landscape orientation. This will allow you to program a pattern by clicking any of the cells.
When the cell switches from yellow to red, after clicking it, that means that the sound labelled to the left of the screen will trigger when the playhead
reaches that location. The names of the samples can be changed by simply clicking on them and editing, ensuring to click the DONE button when finished.
The buttons on the right side of the screen show the different patterns available. Creating a pattern will automatically store it to the pattern bank
associated with whatever button is highlighted on the right. The user can switch between patterns by selecting the different patterns on the right.

Using the application in portrait orientation will switch to the live drum pad, so be careful how you are holding the phone. In the live drum pad you can
configure sounds to be played when you hit the pads. The name of the currently selected sound bank is displayed at the top of the screen.
These settings will be saved as long as the application is installed on your phone. The same is true with the sound banks, which you can edit by clicking
the library button at the top of the screen. This will allow you to search through the files included with this application to build a sound bank.

The record functionality is very basic and allows you to record a sample which you can access from the file browser in soundbank creation. It will be
labelled 'sample.3gp'. You can load in this sound for any sound bank. You can record a sample by selecting the record button in portrait orientation.

Have fun!
